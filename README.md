# Identification-of-Frost-in-Martian-HiRISE-Images
Built a classifier that distinguishes images of Martian terrain with frost. You can find the dataset at https://dataverse.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.48577/jpl.QJ9PYA.
This dataset was created to study Mars’ seasonal frost cycle and its role in the planet’s climate and surface evolution over the past 2 billion years. The data helps identify low-latitude frosted microclimates and their impact on climate.

Example Images:
